To answer later:

- Who was responsible for which part of the project, and how the work was divided.
- A brief description of how your heap (free list) data structure is organized and the algorithms used to manage it.
- A summary of any additional features or improvements in your memory manager or benchmark code. If you did any extra credit parts of the assignment, be sure to describe that.
  If you experimented with various quantities such as the minimum size of a block fragment to keep on the free list, describe your experiments and results obtained.
- A summary of the results you observed on several runs of your bench program. This does not need to be exhaustive (and should not be exhausting), but it should give the reader an idea of how your code worked,
  how fast it was, and how efficient it was in its use of memory.
- A summary of any resources you consulted for information about memory management algorithms. Your code, of course, must be your own, but feel free to research and explore memory management topics.
